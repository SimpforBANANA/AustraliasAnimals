<p class="Easternbrownsnaketext"> Kookaburras are 
  terrestrial tree kingfishers of the genus Dacelo native to
   Australia and New Guinea, which grow to between 28 and 47 cm 
   (11 and 19 in) in length and weigh around 300 g (11 oz). 
   The name is a loanword from Wiradjuri guuguubarra, 
   onomatopoeic of its call. The loud, distinctive call of 
   the laughing kookaburra is widely used as a stock sound 
   effect in situations that involve an Australian bush setting 
   or tropical jungle, especially in older movies.
  They are found in habitats ranging from humid forest to 
  arid savannah, as well as in suburban areas with tall trees
   or near running water. Though they belong to the larger group
    known as "kingfishers", kookaburras are not closely 
    associated with water.</p>
