<p class="Easternbrownsnaketext"> the kangaroo, any of six 
  large species of Australian marsupials noted for 
  hopping and bouncing on their hind legs. The term 
  kangaroo, most specifically used, refers to the eastern 
  gray kangaroo, the western gray kangaroo, and the red 
  kangaroo, as well as to the antilopine kangaroo and two 
  species of wallaroo (see below). Less specifically, 
  kangaroo refers to all 14 species in the genus Macropus, 
  some of which are called wallabies. In its broadest usage,
   kangaroo refers to any member of the family Macropodidae,
    which comprises about 65 species, including tree 
    kangaroos and the quokka; rat kangaroos are classified 
    into “sister” familes, Potoroidae and 
    Hypsiprymnodontidae. The Macropodidae are found 
    in Australia (including Tasmania and other offshore 
    islands, such as Kangaroo Island), New Guinea, and 
    the islands east to the Bismarck Archipelago. 
  Several species have been introduced into New Zealand.</p>
